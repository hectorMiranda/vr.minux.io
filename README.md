# vr.minux.io

**`vr.minux.io`** is the virtual reality (VR) interface layer for the broader **Minux** ecosystem — an open, modular platform blending robotics, AI, web technologies, and human interaction. This repository serves as the entry point for developing immersive VR experiences using platforms like MHWorlds, tightly integrated with the rest of the Minux stack.

## 🧠 About Minux

Minux is an ongoing effort to create a **lean, modular operating shell and ecosystem** that powers:

- Autonomous robots and smart devices
- Embedded systems using C/C++/Rust
- Real-time ML inference (on-device or remote)
- Modular frontends (React-based dashboards, terminals, etc.)
- Experimental GUIs across terminal, web, and VR

The goal is to make **cutting-edge computing approachable and hackable**, from microcontrollers to immersive UIs.

## 🕶 What is vr.minux.io?

This repository focuses on the **virtual reality interface** for Minux. This aims to:

- **Visualize sensor data** and system state in a 3D VR environment
- Allow real-time interaction with robots, simulations, and other Minux modules
- Prototype collaborative spaces for controlling, teaching, or debugging systems
- Serve as a social + spatial interface for the broader minux.io effort

## 🌐 Long-Term Vision

Minux is not just software — it’s a **toolkit for real-world invention**. The VR layer supports:

- **Remote robot operation** via telepresence
- **Immersive dashboards** that react to live sensor feeds (IoT, robotics, etc.)
- **Education & simulation environments** for teaching code, physics, AI
- Integration with **physical fabrication tools** (CNC, 3D printers)
- Future support for open standards like WebXR and VRM avatars

---

## 🧱 Technologies & Tools

- **Meta Horizon Worlds** – for building the immersive front-end
- **Unity (planned)** – to prototype features unavailable in Horizon
- **React + @react-three/fiber** – for the web-3D version
- **ROS2 / micro-ROS / FreeRTOS / Zephyr** – back-end robotics support
- **ESP32, Arduino, Pi** – common microcontroller targets for physical devices

## 🧩 Current Goals

- Port Minux telemetry to a 3D VR visualization (position, status, logs)
- Design a modular control panel for interacting with robots in VR
- Add gesture-based robot control (e.g., wave to start)
- Build collaborative workshop templates (social + interactive)
